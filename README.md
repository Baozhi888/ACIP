![project logo](https://github.com/Baozhi888/ACIP/blob/main/acip2.png)

## Overview

The Adaptive Contextual Intelligence Protocol (ACIP) is a next-generation AI application protocol designed to overcome the limitations of existing protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). ACIP aims to provide a more flexible, secure, and efficient framework for AI applications with a focus on differentiation and rapid development.

ACIP introduces a decentralized architecture with blockchain integration, modular design, native edge computing support, federated learning, and privacy computing capabilities. It targets a wide range of applications including vertical industries (healthcare, finance, manufacturing), edge AI applications, and privacy-sensitive use cases.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Leverage blockchain technology for transparent, secure, and trustworthy protocol operation
- **Modular & Pluggable Design**: Flexible component combination to meet diverse requirements
- **Edge Computing Support**: Optimized for resource-constrained environments
- **Federated Learning Integration**: Privacy-preserving model training across devices/institutions
- **Multi-Protocol Compatibility**: Support for REST API, GraphQL, gRPC and compatibility with MCP
- **Adaptive Context Management**: Dynamic adjustment of context window size based on task complexity
- **Intelligent Model Scheduling**: Automatic selection of optimal AI models based on requirements
- **Security and Authentication**: Decentralized identity (DID) based secure authentication
