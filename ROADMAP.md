# ACIP Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Adaptive Contextual Intelligence Protocol (ACIP), providing visibility into our planned features, improvements, and milestones. This roadmap is a living document that will evolve as the project progresses and as we receive community feedback.

## Roadmap Principles

Our roadmap is guided by these principles:

1. **User-Centered**: Prioritizing features that solve real user problems
2. **Open Development**: Transparent planning and decision-making
3. **Modularity**: Building components that can be adopted incrementally
4. **Interoperability**: Ensuring compatibility with existing AI ecosystems
5. **Security & Privacy**: Designing with security and privacy as core requirements
6. **Performance**: Optimizing for efficiency and scalability

## Current Status

ACIP is currently in the **Alpha** stage of development, focusing on:

- Core protocol architecture refinement
- Reference implementation of key modules
- Documentation of core interfaces and abstractions
- Initial developer tooling
- Community building
